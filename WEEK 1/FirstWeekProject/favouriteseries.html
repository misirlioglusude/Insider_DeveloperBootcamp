            In Season 4, Episode 13 of How to Get Away with Murder, Annalise
            Keating delivers a powerful and emotional speech, addressing her
            personal traumas, past conflicts, and the systemic challenges she
            faces as a Black woman in the legal industry. She openly
            acknowledges her struggles, exposing her vulnerabilities while
            demonstrating immense resilience and determination. Her words
            highlight the deep-seated biases she has battled, from professional
            discrimination to personal hardships, reinforcing the emotional
            weight of her journey. Despite these obstacles, she refuses to be
            broken, reclaiming her strength and agency. This moment not only
            showcases her character's depth but also serves as a broader
            critique of societal inequalities. As she speaks with raw honesty,
            it becomes a pivotal turning point, symbolizing catharsis and
